## Introduction

In this repository, you will find my solutions to various coding problems received from the Daily Coding Problem platform. Each solution is provided in a separate file and is accompanied by a brief explanation of the problem statement and the approach taken to solve it.

## Prerequisites

Before using the code in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Programming Language**: Familiarity with the programming language used for the solutions (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.).
- **Development Environment**: Set up a suitable development environment for running and testing the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-coding-problem.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd daily-coding-problem`
3. Choose the problem you want to explore and open the corresponding file in your preferred code editor.

## Usage

Each solution file is self-contained and can be run independently. Open the file in your chosen programming environment and follow the instructions within the code comments to execute the solution.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different inputs, and explore alternative approaches to solving the problem.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a different or more optimized solution to a problem or have found a bug in the existing code, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-solution` or `bugfix/issue-description`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add new solution'` or `git commit -m 'Fix issue description'`.
4. Push the changes to your forked repository: `git push origin feature/new-solution` or `git push origin bugfix/issue-description`.
5. Submit a pull request explaining your changes.

Please ensure that your code follows the existing style and includes appropriate documentation and tests.
